Hi Team , I'm Udit, a SDET turned Backend Engineer. 
My path through backend engineering and software testing has shaped me into someone 
who builds systems that are fast reliable and ready for real world scale. 
I enjoy creating solutions that make an impact. They stand strong in production 
because every design decision is inspired by both development and testing insight.

At WizCommerce I work as a Backend Software Development Engineer where I focus on 
building and optimizing services that support heavy data and high traffic workloads. 
A recent achievement I am proud of was improving an AI-based image processing pipeline 
through query optimization and implementing async IO which resulted in close to a 50% increase in performance. 
The project helped me sharpen the ability to identify patterns in system behaviour design efficient solutions 
and deliver measurable improvements that directly support the business.

Before my current role I worked as an SDET at Nykaa. That experience shaped my habit of 
thinking through edge cases and anticipating user behaviour which naturally influences 
the way I write APIs handle data flows and structure system logic. I learned to question 
assumptions and design services that remain stable in unexpected scenarios. This focus on 
reliability shortens the dev QA cycle and helps teams ship features with greater confidence.

One project that captures my passion for solving meaningful problems is QureMe an 
AI based brain MRI tumor detection application. I built the backend using 
Python and Flask supported a React interface and trained a CNN model on more than 
8000 MRI scans achieving accuracy above 90%. It reflects my ability to work across 
the stack and my interest in building technology that creates real impact.

I bring experience with Java, Spring Boot, Python, Django, RESTful APIs, FastAPI, 
Selenium, SQL, AWS and more along with a strong foundation from my BE in Computer Science. 
What I offer is not only technical depth but also a mindset that blends precision with creativity. 
I take ownership of my code that is clean scalable and test ready because I believe this 
combination leads to products that are dependable and a delight to use.
